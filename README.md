# Truss structure
Python code to solve 1D problem with geometrically nonlinear
bars and compute hyperelastic and elasto-plastic stresses.

## Dependencies

The finite element program is written using available
tools for FEM in Python.
The integration is realised via Git's `submodule`
feature.

### [CALFEM](https://github.com/CALFEM/calfem-python)
"Computer Aided Learning of the Finite Element Method" is
a set of routines for writing FE code.
